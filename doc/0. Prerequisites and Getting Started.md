# Prerequisites & Getting Started
Let's learn how to set up dotnetVEE to use it! The VEE in dotnetVEE stands for *Video Editing Engine*, which is what it is. A video editor for C# apps.

### 1. Use .NET 6 or .NET 8
Your program will need .NET 6 or .NET 8 to use dotnetVEE. .NET Framework is not supported. .NET 5 and older are not supported because they are out of support, and .NET 7 isn't supported because its support is coming to an end.

### 2. Have ffmpeg and ffprobe
You'll need to download `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` for dotnetVEE to work. You don't necessarily need to install them, just copy over the files into the same directory as your program. You don't even need to add them to PATH.

You can download them from ffmpeg official website, or you can search `how to download ffmpeg`.

`dotnetVEE` is cross-platform, and will automatically use `ffmpeg.exe` or `ffprobe.exe` if the program is running on Windows, otherwise if the program is running on Linux dotnetVEE will automatically use `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` without the .exe extension.

### 3. This is it!
Once ffmpeg and ffprobe are copied over, next up is to simply follow the usage documentation!
