# The `VideoDataQuery` class
The `VideoDataQuery` class found in the `dotnetVEE.Computation.Query` namespace contains 3 static methods to get information about a video only. The `Video` class stores practically everything about a video, and methods to manipulate it, while `VideoDataQuery` class only returns specific information about a video.

Let's say you just want to acquire the amount of FPS from a video, and performance plays a significant role here. The `Video` class not only returns information about FPS in a video, but other information as well, such as resolution, frame count, etc. But what if you just need the FPS from a video and nothing else? The rest of the information would only slow down the task.

Example here:
```cs
using dotnetVEE;
using dotnetVEE.Computation.Query;

public class Test1
{
    public Test1()
    {
        var vid = Video.Create("adorable_cats.mp4");
        Console.WriteLine(vid.RoundedFPS);
    }
}

public class Test2
{
    public Test2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Math.Round(VideoDataQuery.GetFpsCount("adorable_cats.mp4")));
    }
}

_ = new Test1(); // returns 30
_ = new Test2(); // returns 30 also, but a lot faster
```

So, with `VideoDataQuery` class, you can use it to, for example, get FPS from a video *only*. Here are all the methods from this class:

```cs
public static Vector2 GetVideoDimensions(string video)
```
Returns the resolution of a video.

```cs
public static float GetFpsCount(string video)
```
Returns the FPS (Frames Per Second) of a video.

```cs
public static int GetFrameCount(string video)
```
Returns the total amount of frames of a video.
