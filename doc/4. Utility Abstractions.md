# Utility Abstractions
Utility Abstractions are a way to pass configuration and settings for most utilities. Let's talk about most of them!

They are all found in the `dotnetVEE.Abstractions` namespace.

## DeleteGeneratedFiles enum
This enum provides cleanup options for every utility, and is located under the `dotnetVEE.Abstractions.FileGeneration` namespace.

Here's the full source code of this enum:
```cs
/// <summary>
/// An enum consisting of options when it comes to deleting generated
/// files by an utility.
/// </summary>
public enum DeleteGeneratedFiles : byte
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Do not delete any generated files - leave them as is.
    /// </summary>
    None,

    /// <summary>
    /// Delete just the generated video - any changes will be made to
    /// the original video.
    /// </summary>
    VideoOnly,

    /// <summary>
    /// Delete just the frames directory.
    /// </summary>
    FramesDirectoryOnly,

    /// <summary>
    /// Delete both the generated video and the frames directory - any changes
    /// will be made to the original video.
    /// </summary>
    Both
}
```

Basically, each utility will generate a temporary folder and video file.

If you use the `None` value, neither the temporary folder and video file will be deleted.

If you use the `VideoOnly` value, the temporary video file will be deleted and changes will be made to the original video file.

If you use the `FramesDirectoryOnly` value, the frames directory, basically, a temporary directory consisting of selected frames, will be deleted, but the temporary video file will be kept unchanged.

If you use the `Both` value, the frames directory and temporary video file will be deleted, and changes will be made to the original video file.

## GeneratedFileNames record
This record is also found in the `dotnetVEE.Abstractions.FileGeneration` namespace. Here's the full source code of it:
```cs
/// <summary>
/// Specifies names for different generated files by some utility.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="FramesDirectoryName">Name of the generated frames directory (if present).</param>
/// <param name="FramesDirectoryFullPath">Full path to the generated frames directory (if present).</param>
/// <param name="VideoFileName">Name of the generated video file (if present).</param>
/// <param name="VideoFileFullPath">Full path to the generated video file (if present).</param>
public record struct GeneratedFileNames(
    string? FramesDirectoryName,
    string? FramesDirectoryFullPath,
    string? VideoFileName,
    string? VideoFileFullPath
);
```

This record holds paths to file names generated by a utility.

`FramesDirectoryName` holds a relative path to the temporary frames directory. `FramesDirectoryFullPath` stores an absolute path of it.

`VideoFileName` holds a relative path to the temporary video file. `VideoFileFullPath` stores an absolute path of it.

## StartEndTimestamp record
This record is used by many utilities, and it's basically just a combination of two `TimeSpan`s found in the System namespace, and is found in the `dotnetVEE.Abstractions` namespace:
```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents a group of two timestamps to represent start-and-end.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="Start">Start timestamp.</param>
/// <param name="End">End timestamp.</param>
public record StartEndTimestamp(
    TimeSpan Start,
    TimeSpan End);
```
It represents the start &amp; end timestamps for a utility, for instance, where the effect appears (start) and vanishes (end).

## RgbaRF record
This is just a representation of an RGBA color using `float`. Very simple. Found in the `dotnetVEE.Abstractions` namespace:
```cs
/// <summary>
/// Represents a simple RGBA Record of Floats (abbreviated to RgbaRF).
/// </summary>
/// <param name="R">The R field (Red).</param>
/// <param name="G">The G field (Green).</param>
/// <param name="B">The B field (Blue).</param>
/// <param name="A">The A field (Alpha).</param>
public record struct RgbaRF(
    float R,
    float G,
    float B,
    float A = 1F
);
```
It also has an extension method called `ToSixLaborsRgba32(this RgbaRF)`, which converts it to `Rgba32` defined in the `SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats` namespace, but it's only useful if you use ImageSharp:
```cs
/// <summary>
/// Extensions for <see cref="RgbaRF" />.
/// </summary>
public static class RgbaRFExtensions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Converts the instance of <see cref="RgbaRF" /> to <see cref="Rgba32" />.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="rf">The instance of <see cref="RgbaRF" /> to convert.</param>
    /// <returns>An instance of the <see cref="Rgba32" /> struct from SixLabors.ImageSharp, converted from <see cref="RgbaRF" />.</returns>
    public static Rgba32 ToSixLaborsRgba32(this RgbaRF rf)
        => new Rgba32(rf.R, rf.G, rf.B, rf.A);
}
```
