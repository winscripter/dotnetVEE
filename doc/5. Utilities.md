# Utilities
By now, you've pretty much learned the basics of `dotnetVEE`. Let's get into actual video editing!üìΩÔ∏è

Utilities are a quick way to add something into a video, like a rectangle or text.

dotnetVEE offers a few utilities found in the `dotnetVEE.Computation.Utils` namespace. If it feels too limited, you can create your own utility too, which we'll talk about in the later chapters. But I will definitely add even more predefined utilities in later versions!

# AddText utility
This utility is self-explanatory- it adds static text to a video.

```cs
/// <summary>
/// A utility to add text to a video within given timestamps.
/// </summary>
public class AddText : IUtility
```

### Example
```cs
using dotnetVEE;
using dotnetVEE.Abstractions;
using dotnetVEE.Computation.Options;
using dotnetVEE.Computation.Utils;
using SixLabors.Fonts;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp.PixelFormats;
using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
using System.Collections.Specialized;

Video video = Video.Create("seagulls.mp4");

Font font = new FontCollection()
                .Add("SpaceGrotesk.ttf") // Add font file SpaceGrotesk.ttf- does not require the font to be installed
                .CreateFont(30F); // Make its size 30 pixels

var options = new TextComputationOptions(
    "Hello, World!",
    new Rgba32(0xFF, 0x00, 0x00) /* red RGB*/,
    new Point(128, 36),
    font);

var timestamp = new StartEndTimestamp(
    new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 1, 500),
    new TimeSpan(0, 0, 0, 3)); // the text will appear at 00:00:01.500 and will vanish at 00:00:03.000

bool leaveGeneratedFile = false; // set this to true if you don't want the original video to be overwrtiten.

IUtility util = new AddText(options, timestamp, leaveGeneratedFile);

var collection = new ObservableCollection<float>();
util.Run(video, ref collection);
```

Paste the font and video, run the code, and see the magic happen - the original video will be overwritten (set leaveGeneratedFile to `true` to prevent this). But the video will have the text "Hello, World!" at 128x36 with the red font and 30 pixels size with the Space Grotesk font. It will appear at 00:00:01.500 and will last 1.5 seconds.

This is an example of one utility - the documentation for other utilities are located under the `utildoc` folder. This is just to get better context.
