First version of `dotnetVEE` to have a minor version incremented!

1.1.0 is a major update that added 3 new features and 1 change:

## Changes
- The `Video` class now supports the `ConcatenateWith` method, which concatenates that video with another one (adds video to the end)
- dotnetVEE now supports Video to GIF conversion and various image format conversions:
  ```cs
using dotnetVEE.Computation.Converters;

string gifFile = GifConverter.FromVideo("cats.mp4");
// gifFile holds path to the converted GIF image format
  ```
- Added new Extended Effect: `Scale`: allows you to scale by X/Y (zoom in/out) of a video.
- Removed redundant TODO in TextAppearanceUtility.cs
