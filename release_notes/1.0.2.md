# dotnetVEE 1.0.2 Release Notes
This is a minor update.

### Changes
- dotnetVEE now uses SixLabors.ImageSharp 3.1.4; 3.1.3 had a high security vulnerability
- all packages were updated and are now up-to-date
- fixed miserable bug where I forgot to disable logging for some utilities for debugging purposes
